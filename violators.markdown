<p>The following Stream Raiders captains have violated the <a href="https://captain.tv/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guidelines</a> by allowing, supporting, promoting, encouraging or spreading harassment in their communities. Of course, most of them would deny any such activity. Sometimes even going as far as stating the opposite and claiming it's not based on anything factual or lacking any rhyme or reason.</p>

To all the captains that assume people are bots and state "If you are not - please say so in chat":
<blockquote><p>AmicuNoa: ...creating an unpleasant situation by forcing an unwanted contact ... is harassment</p></blockquote>

<p>The harassment will doubtfully stop spreading faster than COVID19 until CTV start to actually enforce their own Guidelines. In other words, never.</p>

<!-- <p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you got banned by one of these captains while they were in your favorites and now you have a blank favorite taking up space on your captain selection screen - get in touch, we can help you remove them without waiting an eternity for a reply from support and without using any 3rd party applications.</p> -->

<!-- <p style="font-size:larger"><b>Thanks to all players who report harassment incidents (including factual evidence) to us directly, helping keeping this list up-to-date!</b></p>
<p>All evidence is double-checked against VODs. If the captain has VODs disabled or paywalled the evidence is assumed valid until proven otherwise.</p> -->

<blockquote><p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/500415558257344514/992978656152535090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2 July, 2022]</a> ctv_kermond: ... calling out specific Captains is a specific no-no - you can use the Reporting function for that!</p></blockquote>

<p>But calling out specific Players is a specific yes-yes, apparently. It is common knowledge that all reports are ignored. You might as well toss a coin into a wishing well for a better effect.</p>

<p>All these harassing captains are a nuisance and should be banned. Their typical behavior is to offend (often kicked off by members of their chat) new players placing in their battles, get excited about more rewards after the battles, immediately decide to avoid granting rewards to these players, get very surprised when they leave never to return causing battle rewards number to dwindle. Yet they don't bother to appologize for the harassment.</p>

<p>If you get banned by one of them under the false accusation of botting we strongly advice you <b>NOT</b> to support their harassment by coming an their chat and begging for an unban (You've already lost any loyalty progress with them). Instead we encourage you to report them by clicking the names on the list, even though CTV immediately discards the reports without reading them. If you have a Discord account it's even better to message <b>EACH</b> of the CTV staff members directly and report this harassment incident, complaining in public channels is futile.</p>
