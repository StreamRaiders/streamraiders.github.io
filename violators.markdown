# The following captains have violated the [Guidelines](https://captain.tv/guidelines) by allowing, supporting, promoting, encouraging or spreading harassment in their communities.
###### Of course, most of them would deny any such activity. Sometimes even going as far as stating the opposite and claiming it's not based on anything factual.

> [2 July, 2022] ctv_kermond: ... calling out specific Captains is a specific no-no - you can use the Reporting function for that!

##### But calling out specific Players is a specific yes-yes, apparently.
##### It is common knowledge that all reports are ignored. You might as well toss a coin into a wishing well for a better effect.
