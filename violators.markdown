description: Stream Raiders captains that violate the Guidelines by harassing the players

<div style="display: flex">
<div style="flex: 1">

<p>The following Stream Raiders captains have violated the <a href="https://captain.tv/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guidelines</a> by allowing, supporting, promoting, encouraging or spreading harassment in their communities. Of course, most of them would deny any such activity. Sometimes even going as far as stating the opposite and claiming it's not based on anything factual or lacking any rhyme or reason.</p>

<p>The harassment will doubtfully stop spreading faster than COVID19 until CTV start to actually enforce their own Guidelines. In other words, never.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you got banned by one of these captains while they were in your favorites and now you have a blank favorite taking up space on your captain selection screen - get in touch, we can help you remove them without waiting an eternity for a reply from support and without using any 3rd party applications.</p>

<p style="font-size:larger"><b>Thanks to all players who report harassment incidents (including factual evidence) to us directly, helping keeping this list up-to-date!</b></p>
<p>All evidence is double-checked against VODs. If the captain has VODs disabled or paywalled the evidence is assumed valid until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>But calling out specific Players is a specific yes-yes, apparently. It is common knowledge that all reports are ignored. You might as well toss a coin into a wishing well for a better effect.</p>
