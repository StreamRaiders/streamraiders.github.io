	<summary>About Stream Raiders</summary>
	<p style="font-size:smaller">Stream Raiders is a fake free-to-play game: If you don't pay for the battlepass regularly and don't purchase skins you are treated like garbage, not only by the CTV team but also by promoted members of the community with <a href="https://twitter.com/yayitsyenny/status/1540022113758756865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elitism</a> mental issues <span style="color: #bbb">(The tweet has since been deleted without any apologies, admitting the condition described)</span>. Rampant <a href="/botters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">botting</a> is prevelant as well, especially with <a href="/botters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">botters</a> accusing legit players of botting to divert the attention from own <a href="/botters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bot accounts</a>.</p>
	<p style="font-size:smaller">Beyond that your account can be suspended at any time at a whim by CTV without providing you with any reasoning as well as blocking and/or ignoring all your attempts at communication. Therefore, spending money on this game is ill-advised.</p>
	<p style="font-size:smaller">Captain discovery has been broken and often showing no results since <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1029491788962086912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">03.10.2022</a> and yet CTV has not done anything to address this issue: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1043710008552067122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1043714297047556217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1043771121213902898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1046082864439119952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/500415557800296449/517216760768888836/1046246073804542003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five</a>. We've seen several reports that using the <code>/t/</code> links at the top of the streamer's view you can workaround this issue.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0px">TL;DR: Do not play this game if possible. There are better and fairer free-to-play games, even on steam.</p>
