## How well are Stream Raiders captains at following the Guidelines?
## How reliable are Stream Raiders captains in running their battles, contrary to their claims?

###### Stream Raiders is a fake free-to-play game: If you don't pay for the battlepass regularly and don't purchase skins you are treated like garbage, not only by the CTV team but also by promoted members of the community with [elitism](https://twitter.com/yayitsyenny/status/1540022113758756865) mental issues.
###### Beyond that your account can be suspended at any time at a whim by CTV without providing you with any reasoning as well as blocking and/or ignoring all your attempts at communication. Therefore, spending money on this game is ill-advised.
##### TL;DR: Do not play this game if possible. There are better and fairer free-to-play games, even on steam.
